### Wraeclast

Wraeclast is my homeserver powered by ArchLinux. This repo is a monorepo of various applications that are running on the homeserver using Docker. Every application gets a sub-directory under the `apps/` directory. The repo is integrated with dokploy running on the same server. Whenever a change is made to the repo, dokploy will automatically deploy the changes to the server.
